         <h1>Is this making sense?</h1>
          
            <p>This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site.</p>

              <h2>1. Some boxes in a row.</h2>
                <p>Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.</p>
          

                  <div class="blocks first">B</div>
                  <div class="blocks new">L</div>
                  <div class="blocks">O</div>
                  <div class="blocks">C</div>
                  <div class="blocks new">K</div>
                  <div class="blocks">S</div>
                  <div class="blocks">!</div>

              <h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2>
                <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <span class="code">width: 100%;</span>. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like <span class="code">font-family: monospace;</span>.</p>

              <h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
                <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
